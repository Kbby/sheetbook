### Work in progress: translating the sheetbook in italian!


This is the central place to manage the Rhythms of Resistance tunesheets. The website and other places link to the generated files in this repository.

[`front.svg`](./front.svg) and [`back.svg`](./back.svg) contain the front and back cover. A `[month]` placeholder can be used to automatically fill in the current month+year.

[`network.odt`](./network.odt) is the description of the RoR network, principles, history and RoR Player.

[`tunes.ods`](./tunes.ods) contains the tune and dance sheets.


Update
======

If you added new pages to the tunesheet or moved pages around, make sure to update the page numbers in the [`make-sheets.sh`](./make-sheets.sh) script.

PDF files are automatically generated and published to the [master branch](https://github.com/rhythms-of-resistance/sheetbook/tree/master) when committing changes.

If you want to do a manual rebuild, follow one of the following instructions.

### Manual update using docker

This is the most reliable way, as no dependencies/fonts (except docker) have to be installed.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/home/ror/sheetbook" rhythmsofresistance/sheetbook-build
```

### Manual update using script

Make sure to have the [BTNGrilledCheese](./BTNGrilledCheese.zip) font and LibreOffice, Inkscape, qpdf, pdfjam and pdfnup installed.

Then run `./make-sheets.sh`.
